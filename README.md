# WordPress Share to Facebook Page 

```
Facebook API: v2.11
```

This is an **incomplete** attempt at creating a WordPress plugin to automatically post WordPress posts to a Facebook page.

I'm leaving this here as a reminder to myself to **always** do research on the problem at hand before starting to code.

I spent collectively about 12 hours doing this plugin (it's almost done, really) before I _remembered_ that [JetPack](https://jetpack.com/) already does this through something called Publicize.

Still, it's good code and has little to-dos left.
